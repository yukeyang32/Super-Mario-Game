Specific comments on code quality: This class is of high code quality, the fields are clear and correct on the scope (public vs private).
The class and methods are cohesive, and coupling is not too tight. If the function is to be changed in the future, I think the class may still 
be easy to maintain, just change the loading and several constant numbers.
