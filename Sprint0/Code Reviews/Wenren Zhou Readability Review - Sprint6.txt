   There are a bunch of condition checking statements in the Update() and Draw() methods in Game1.cs, which increase
   the difficulty to read and understand the code and reasons behind. The logic of the order of lines within some methods
   are not very clear, either.

   Some of the constant values in the ConstantNubmer.cs can be integrated together 
   to reduce the total amount of constant values and make the class more clear; the grouping can also be better 
   to improve the understandability.

   There is inconsistency of adjustment values for either positions or dimensions in the Mario state classes, 
   even when Mario is in the the sprite status; could recheck all the values to improve consistency.
