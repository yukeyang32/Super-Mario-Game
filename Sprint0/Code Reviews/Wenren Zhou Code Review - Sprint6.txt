7. Specific comments: 

   The loops and switch cases in LevelLoader can lead to higher complexity, which is not the best practice; 
   separating out the checking and responding statements might be helpful.

   Game1.cs has multiple methods and if statements to check whether the display is in Menu mode or Playing mode, which decreases the cohesion. 
   Could consider writing state classes for the display and having all the work done there.

   There are many Mario state classes; could reduce the number of classes by using singleton pattern for Star Mario.
