Team2 Mario Reflection:

Again, Sprint 6 went by pretty smoothly for us as we also had a pretty good separation of tasks. THis allowed us to all work on 
our different projects (Wenren on menu, Jeffrey on level, Wenbo/Keyang on 2P/PK mode) without impeding each other much,
so that helped a lot for working during the project week. 

Most of the code seems to get written without large bugs, and bugs are relatively easier to fix with working early rather than last minute implementation
and debug of different new features for the sprints. It seems like all of the items on the burndown chart were able to be completed in a reasonable time without many
bugs with the functionality of the game itself.
