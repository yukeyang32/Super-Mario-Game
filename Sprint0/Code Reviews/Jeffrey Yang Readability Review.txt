I think the inconsistencies with how the states are named (sometimes size/direction/state/mario, or mario/direction/stae, etc) can be confusing and lead to potential errors if methods aren't consistently named.
Since there are so many methods, it can be hard from a readability standpoint to know every single method name, so they should be named consistently so that anyone reading/using the code will know all the functionality is related.
