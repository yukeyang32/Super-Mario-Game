Menu.cs

Menu.cs seems to be implemented well for the current status of the class. With not that many levels to pick from, there isnt a real necessity to combine all of the 
locations of menu options as well as their names/other stuff in a data structure. However, if the number of selectable levels did go up by a lot, then we may need to 
put all of the levels into a data structure and also all of the names/locations into an associated structure so that we could access them both. This would only really be necessary
for expansion of selectable levels. By doing this we could reduce a lot of runtime logic if we didn't have to always check for the specific number location (menu location 1,2,3,4, etc).
Instead just giving something different depending onselection instead of having every single option have a different whole menu write as it is now.
