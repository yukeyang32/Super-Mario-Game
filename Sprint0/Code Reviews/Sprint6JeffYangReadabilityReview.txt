Main Menu (Menu.cs)

15 minutes

The menu file seems pretty readable. A lot of the magic numbers are put into the constants class so the used numbers are more self-explanatory than a random number.
The level names are easily understandable in the beginning of the file with level 1, 2, pk mode, and exit.
I think when adding a lot more levels to the selector this may require a lot more listed items, which could impact readability if there are large walls of text due to all the levels.
At the moment though I think this is a good format for the class. A lot of Menu.cs is self explanatory and easy to understand.
