Team2 Mario Reflection:

Our team’s time and project management could have some improvement over a few areas. We felt like we were pretty rushed on both the initial implementation 
as well as the final refactored implementation for Sprint 2. Part of this may have been due to lack of communication on code design, having to learn git 
alongside contributing code, as well as being able to properly use the sprint boards as part of Azure Devops.


In the end we felt like we did a good job working together when we met in person and were able to complete tasks quickly when we were able to explain to 
each other what our thought processes were while we were coding rather than telling each other how the code worked the next day. This experience will 
contribute to how we plan for our future sprints with more in person meetings to hash out design and implementation details in order to save much more 
time in the future as well as have a more coherent code layout.
